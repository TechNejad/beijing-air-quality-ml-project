# Beijing Air Quality – A Machine Learning Project

**Work in Progress**  
This repository documents an ongoing machine learning project analyzing air pollution in Beijing (2010–2014). It is being developed as part of the 'Topics on Machine Learning and its Applications' course as part of the Master's of Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Societies (AISS).

## Project Overview

This project explores temporal and meteorological patterns in Beijing’s air quality using real-world PM2.5 sensor data. Following the **CRISP-DM methodology**, the notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling (in progress). The project is designed to reflect a thoughtful, beginner-level understanding of python for data science and ML techniques.
